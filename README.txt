AlCu (Alum)
A weekend-project ("Rush") at Codam (42).
The project is designed to be finished by a group of two people in 48 hours.
Alcu is a matches game. At the start there is generated a random map of several lines of matches. Each line has different amount of matches. The player is against the computer and can take 1-3 matches from current row (if there are only 2 matches on current row player can take 1 or 2 matches). The player taking the last match from the last row loses. The game starts from the bottom of the desk.
